# ArtificialIntelligence-ResearchProject

The aim of this project was to explore the powerful tools pycaret has to offer by creating models for a given dataset and performing all stages of the machine learning pipeline on it. I had chosen to do four models; svm, knn, ridge, and lasso, to compare their results. The results are as follows:

Model	                                               MAE	 MSE	 RMSE	    R2      RMSLE	 MAPE
0	Support Vector Regression	0.8359	1.0306	1.0152	0.3089	0.0868	0.0801

Model	                                        MAE    MSE   RMSE	 R2  RMSLE  MAPE
0	K Neighbors Regressor	0.0001	0.0	  0.001	1.0	0.0001	0.0

Model	                                MAE	 MSE	 RMSE	    R2      RMSLE	 MAPE
0	Ridge Regression	0.7201	0.792	0.8899	0.4689	0.0761	0.0682

Model	                                MAE	 MSE     RMSE	    R2      RMSLE	 MAPE
0	Lasso Regression	0.9181	1.232	1.11	0.1738	0.0946	0.0869

The final result was that overall ridge had a much smaller error spread across all these metrics.
